	<brief_description>
		A helper node to allow [MultiMesh] resources to instance their input [Mesh] along a [Path3D] node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node takes the MultiMesh resource and creates instances along the Path3D.  The PathMultiMesh3D node can control the alignment, distribution, offset, and other properties of each instance along the path.

	<brief_description>
		PathArea3D creates an area by duplicating the input shape along a [Path3D].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node takes the input shape and duplicates it along a [Path3D] with specified parameters. It is meant to quickly create simple areas along a path. The shape can be transformed to be relative to the path node or local to the PathArea3D node.

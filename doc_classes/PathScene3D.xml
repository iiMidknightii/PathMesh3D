	<brief_description>
		A helper node to instance a [PackedScene] along a [Path3D] node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node takes the PackedScene resource and creates instances along the Path3D.  The PathScene3D node can control the alignment, distribution, offset, and other properties of each instance along the path.

	<methods>
		<method name="bake_instances">
			<return type="Node3D[]" />
			<description>
				Unparents the instances from the PathScene3D node and returns them in an array for reparenting.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="queue_rebuild">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Rebuilds the instances along the path. This method is called automatically when the path changes, but it can be called manually to force an update.
